# WastefullDB Article Contribution Guidelines

## Our Mission & Perspective

Wastefull.org is a nonprofit focused on waste diversion education with a **longtermist perspective**. We prioritize solutions that work at scale and over time, considering environmental justice, global equity, and systems change rather than just individual actions.

## Core Principles for All Articles

- **Evidence-based approaches** with Wikipedia-style citations like [1], [2], [3]
- **Systems thinking** over individual-only solutions
- **Realistic optimism** about emerging technologies and innovations
- **Full lifecycle impact** consideration
- **Scalability** and long-term viability focus

## Article Classification

### Process Types
- **Recycling**: Industrial or small-scale processing, preparation requirements, cost and energy considerations
- **Upcycling**: Creative reuse, value-added applications, DIY projects, artistic expression, entertainment (toys, games)
- **Composting**: Biodegradation processes, from traditional to biotechnology approaches

### Implementation Levels
- **DIY**: Home-, individual-, and small community-scale methods
- **Industrial**: Commercial/municipal scale processing
- **Experimental**: Emerging technologies, research-stage innovations

## Required Content Structure

### Essential Sections
1. **Technical Foundation** - Current science, material composition, processing pathways
2. **Practical Implementation** - Step-by-step guidance, tools, safety considerations
3. **Systems Analysis** - Policy implications, infrastructure needs, economic models
4. **Future Outlook** - Emerging technologies, research gaps, innovation opportunities

### Safety Requirements
Every article **must include** a dedicated "Safety Considerations" section covering:
- Personal protective equipment
- Ventilation and environmental controls
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Emergency procedures where applicable

### Innovation Approach
- Frame current limitations as **development timelines**, not permanent barriers
- Reference breakthrough technologies as natural extensions of research
- Mark development areas with [RESEARCH GAP] or [INNOVATION NEEDED]
- Take the position that technical challenges can be solved through R&D investment

## Citation Standards

- Use Wikipedia-style numbered citations like [1], [2], [3] for all factual claims
- **Preferred sources** (but not limited to):
  - EPA guidelines and government agencies
  - Academic institutions (Cornell Waste Management Institute)
  - Industry associations (USCC, ISRI, BPI)
  - Research foundations (Ellen MacArthur Foundation)
  - Reputable authors in the regenerative space such as Matt Powers, Elaine Ingham, and others
  - Peer-reviewed studies and technical reports

### Citation Format Examples
```
[1] EPA Recycling Guidelines, "Material Recovery Standards," 2024
[2] Cornell Waste Management Institute, "Composting Technology Review," 2023
```

## Tone & Voice Guidelines

- **Forward-looking and matter-of-fact** about emerging technologies
- Use phrases like "falls under emerging technology" rather than "impossible"
- **Comprehensive yet accessible** - expert depth with practical clarity
- **Solutions-oriented** while acknowledging current constraints
- **Global perspective** considering equity and justice implications

## Length & Detail Expectations

- Length can be as concise or as detailed as needed; glaring omissions will need to be filled in by our staff volunteers
- **Specific, actionable guidance** rather than generic advice
- **Multiple implementation pathways** when applicable
- **Clear success indicators** and quality metrics
- **Environmental impact analysis**
- **Systems considerations** covering policy and scaling challenges

## Quality Standards

### Technical Accuracy
- Verify all scientific claims with reputable sources
- Include temperature, time, and material specifications where relevant
- Address contamination and safety risks honestly

### Practical Utility
- Provide specific tools, materials, and equipment lists
- Include realistic timeframes and difficulty assessments
- Offer troubleshooting guidance and success indicators

### Systems Perspective
- Consider when your recommended method is optimal vs. alternatives
- Address infrastructure and policy requirements
- Include economic and social considerations
